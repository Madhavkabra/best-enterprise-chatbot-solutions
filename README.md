# Top 25 Enterprise Chatbot Solutions in 2025

## üè¢ What Is an Enterprise Chatbot?

An **enterprise chatbot** is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to handle large-scale, business-critical interactions across customer support, IT operations, HR workflows, and internal knowledge management. Unlike consumer chatbots, enterprise-grade bots are built for **scalability, security, integration, and compliance**.

These bots can operate across multiple departments, support millions of conversations, connect to various tools (like CRMs, helpdesks, or ERPs), and learn continuously to deliver more relevant and accurate responses over time.
